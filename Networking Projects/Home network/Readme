Creating a simple home network without any tutorials or help. Even though i've made more robust projects in school including protocols 
and servers, i wanted to try and recreate my own network using PT. 

The setup consists of two home routers, each with its own network though connected to eachother to have the same connection to the ISP.
Inside the network there is a landline and a PC connected directly to the main router, the rest of the devices being wireless 
devices and IoT's like smartphones, smart TV's, and a bluetooth speaker. 

Both routers have WPA 2 Personal security with the password "HomeNetwork".
