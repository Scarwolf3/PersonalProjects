A simple java calculator with some limitations.

v 1.0 works as intended, the only limiting factor is it doesn't handle multiple types of operations at once. First press the equals (=) button to do another operation to the first result.
Multiple operations of the same type are supported.
The calc has 3 screens, this is to show the user its functionality. In reality the final product would only show the center-top one.
that first screen displays the operations and numbers the user imputs and at the end also the result. 
The second screen shows the current count and is used in the code for doing the operations one at a time.
The third (leftmost) screen is the current total. Here we can tell if there is any error in the programming logic. 

Created in Java using Apache NetBeans.
